# Python implementation for `Speckle AI`

## How to get started?

This project requires `python>=3.10`.

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lukegehron/speckle-ai
```

2. Install the needed dependencies

```bash
cd speckle-ai/python_implementation
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the application (you should see it at `localhost:7860` or `0.0.0.0:7860`):

```bash
python3 app.py
```

## How to use the app?

The application interface is simple and intuitive:

- You need to pass **your FAL AI API key**, a **prompt** and a **PNG image**
- You can optionally pass a **seed** (otherwise leave it as it is)

You then just click `Submit` and wait for the results! 

Your Speckle model and the generated realistic image will be shown in 10-15 s.
